    "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed how organizations think about artificial intelligence. "
    "Rather than building narrow AI solutions for specific tasks, companies can now use LLMs as general-purpose engines capable of adapting to a wide range of needs, "
    "from customer support automation to creative writing assistance. "
    "However, deploying these models effectively requires more than just access to powerful algorithms; it demands thoughtful integration into real-world workflows.\n\n"
    
    "LangChain is a leading open-source Python framework that helps developers bridge this gap. "
    "By offering modular building blocks such as prompt templates, memory management systems, agent creation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, "
    "and multi-modal tool integration, LangChain enables developers to create dynamic applications that leverage the full power of LLMs while remaining customizable to specific business goals.\n\n"
    
    "Beyond technical tooling, LangChain also promotes responsible AI usage. It encourages incorporating retrieval systems to ground answers in trusted documents, "
    "thus reducing hallucination risks, and supports conversation memory to maintain context across multi-turn dialogues.\n\n"
    
    "As enterprises and startups alike explore the potential of LLM-driven applications, frameworks like LangChain are becoming essential. "
    "They not only speed up prototyping but also pave the way for production-grade deployments by offering standardized patterns and best practices. "
    "In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, mastering tools like LangChain will likely be a key differentiator for developers and organizations seeking to stay ahead."

# Execute the Chain
# Invoke the summarization chain by providing the input text
# - 'invoke' takes a dictionary mapping input variable names to their actual values
summary = summarize_chain.invoke({"text": text})


# Output the Result (summarized to fifty words)
# Print the summarized text produced by the model
print("Summary:", summary)
