Each package serves a specific purpose in our chatbot pipeline:\n\n- **`ollama`**: This package allows us to run large language models (LLMs) locally. It simplifies interactions with models like LLaMA and Mistral.\n- **`langchain`**: A framework for building applications powered by LLMs. It provides tools for chaining prompts, managing memory, and integrating models.\n- **`chromadb`**: A vector database used for storing and retrieving text embeddings. This is essential for making the chatbot context-aware.\n- **`gradio`**: A simple way to build web-based interfaces for machine learning models. Weâ€™ll use it to create a user-friendly chatbot interface.\n- **`langchain-community`**: A collection of integrations and utilities that extend `langchain`, making it easier to work with external tools and databases.\n- **`pymupdf`**: To work with PDF documents, we need to install `pymupdf` which makes it easy to handle PDF files.

Hmm, I remember it has something to do with force and acceleration. Let me think. It was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, right? So he probably made some experiments or observations that led him to this big formula.\n","\n","Wait, what does the law say exactly? Oh, right, it states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. So in equation form, F = ma. That makes sense because if something has more mass or accelerates more, there must be a greater force causing it.\n","\n","I should probably break this down into parts. First, what is force? I know force is push or pull on an object, but Newton's Law is about how that force relates to mass and acceleration. So F equals m times a. \n","\n","Let me think of some examples. If I hit a ball with my foot, the ball accelerates towards the ground. The greater the force from the foot, the more the ball speeds upâ€”so mass plays a role. Similarly, if I have two objects of different masses but are pushed by the same force, one should accelerate faster because it's less massive. That example makes sense.\n","\n","What about direction? Newton's Law applies in any direction. So even if something is moving diagonally across a field, like a projectile, the net force affects its acceleration in that direction as well.\n","\n","Wait, I've heard about inertia before. Inertia is resistance to change in motion. So when you step on the gas in your car and it skids, you feel pushed back. That's because your inertia resists that changeâ€”Newton's Second Law explains why a heavier object would skid more easily but also needs more force applied.\n","\n","I should make sure I understand how to apply this law. For example, if I know the mass of an object and its acceleration due to gravity, I can find out the gravitational force acting on it. Since g is approximately 9.8 m/sÂ², F = m * 9.8, which gives me the weight.\n","\n","What about when two forces are acting on an object? Like a book resting on a table has two forces: the gravitational pull downward and the normal force upward. These balance each other out because the net force is zeroâ€”so no acceleration. This would be why the book doesn't fall off.\n","\n","Oh, right! If only one of these forces exists, like just the gravitational pull, it would cause the book to accelerate towards the table. That's an example where F = ma works because there are two forces acting on it, leading to a net force that causes acceleration.\n","\n","I should also think about how this law is used in real life. When designing cars, understanding friction and inertia helps with stopping distances. In sports, like throwing a ball, the force applied affects its trajectory. It's all about being able to calculate the forces involved to predict behavior accurately.\n","\n","Wait, what if there are multiple directions? If I push a box at an angle, both horizontally and vertically, the net force would affect acceleration in each direction separately. So the horizontal component of the push causes more horizontal acceleration, while the vertical component might counteract gravity or other forces acting on it.\n","\n","I think I have a good grasp now. Newton's Second Law is fundamental because it links force, mass, and acceleration across various contexts. It helps explain why things behave as they do in the world around us.\n","</think>\n","\n","**Newton's Second Law of Motion Explained**\n","\n","Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). This law establishes a direct relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. \n","\n","- **Force**: The push or pull acting on an object.\n","- **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object.\n","- **Acceleration**: The rate at which velocity changes over time.\n","\n","### Examples and Applications\n","\n","1. **Impact on Acceleration**:\n","   - If a ball is hit by your foot, its acceleration increases because the net force (from the foot) causes it to speed up. A larger mass or greater acceleration result from this force.\n","\n","2. **Directional Effects**:\n","   - Newton's Law applies in any direction. For example, when firing a projectile, the net force affects its acceleration in that direction, whether horizontal or diagonal.\n","\n","3. **Inertia and Resistance**:\n","   - Inertia is resistance to motion change. When you step on the gas in your car, inertia resists skiddingâ€”Newton's Second Law explains this with F = ma, where mass is greater for heavier objects.\n","\n","4. **Two-Force Example**:\n","   - A book resting on a table experiences two forces: gravity downward and normal force upward. Since net force is zero, no acceleration occurs. However, if one force exists (e.g., gravity), the book accelerates toward the table.\n","\n","5. **Multiple Directions**:\n","   - Pushing at an angle applies forces in multiple directions, each influencing acceleration independentlyâ€”horizontal and vertical components of push affect respective axes.\n","\n","### Real-World Applications\n","\n","- Designing cars relies on friction and inertia to reduce stopping distances.\n","- Sports like baseball use force application to predict trajectory accurately.\n","- Understanding how to distribute forces ensures correct acceleration outcomes.\n","\n","Newton's Second Law is foundational, linking force, mass, and acceleration across various contexts, explaining everyday phenomena and practical applications.\n"]}]},{"source":"## Preprocess the PDF Document for RAG\n\nWe will now create a function that pre-processes the PDF file for RAG.

This ensures that DeepSeek receives a **well-organized input** for better reasoning.\n- **Generates the response**: Calls `ollama_llm(question, formatted_content)`, which:  \n    - Passes the structured input to `deepseek-r1:1.5b` for processing.  \n    - Cleans up the response (removes `<think>` tags).  \n    - Returns a polished, fact-based answer.","metadata":{},"id":"106285be-8517-4744-bae6-81722e6e0d5c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Define rag_chain function for Retrieval Augmented Generation\ndef rag_chain(question, text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes as input:\n        - The question we want to ask the model\n        - The text_splitter object to split the PDF and read into chunks\n        - The vectorstore for retrieving embeddings \n        - The retriever objects which retrieves data from the vectorstore\n    \"\"\"\n    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question) # In this step, we will find the part of the document most relevant to the question\n    formatted_content = combine_docs(retrieved_docs) # We will then combine the retrieved parts of the document \n    return ollama_llm(question, formatted_content) # Run the model on the question, and the relevant context from the document ","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"id":"ecf97fc9-c2a1-45c0-b716-56c5a9d30708","cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Put it all together â€” Create a function that performs the logic expected by the Chatbot  \ndef ask_question(pdf_bytes, question): \n    text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever = process_pdf(pdf_bytes) # Process the PDF\n    if text_splitter is None:\n        return None  # No PDF uploaded    \n    result = rag_chain(question, text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever) # Return the results with RAG\n    return {result}","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"id":"28e6a285-8920-4717-a33d-972c3e54e19d","cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## **Building a Chat Interface with Gradio**","metadata":{},"id":"1a9e8fcf-1d5f-4c5c-9bc2-9a14550eee1c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Define a Gradio interface\ninterface = gr.Interface(\n    fn=ask_question,  # The function that processes user input and generates a response (logic of the app)\n    inputs=[\n        gr.File(label=\"Upload PDF (optional)\"),  # Optional file upload input for a PDF document\n        gr.Textbox(label=\"Ask a question\")  # Text input where the user types their question\n    ],\n    outputs=\"text\",  # The function returns a text response\n    title=\"Ask questions about your PDF\",  # The title displayed on the interface\n    description=\"Use DeepSeek-R1 1.5B to answer your questions about the uploaded PDF document.\",  # Brief description of the interface's functionality\n)\n\n# Launch the Gradio interface to start the web-based app\ninterface.launch()","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"id":"bbbdfcc2-466b-4190-8711-b9ebce57b1b3","cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7865\n","\n","To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div><iframe src=\"http://127.0.0.1:7865/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" allow=\"autoplay; camera; microphone; clipboard-read; clipboard-write;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":[]},"execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"source":"## **How to uninstall Ollama and DeepSeek?**\n\n**To uninstall Ollama**\n\nTo uninstall Ollama\n\n- macOS: Delete Ollama from applications\n- Windows: Uninstall Ollama using control panel\n\n**To uninstall DeepSeek**\n\nSearch for these folders on your computer â€” delete these folders. \n\n- macOS: ~/.ollama/models\n- Windows: C:\\Users\\%username%\\.ollama\\models\n","metadata":{},"id":"e71f0953-6a97-469a-825c-22161f386acb","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
